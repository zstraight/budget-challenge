Project for sociology class to reflect the difficulties undocumented immigrants who are parents face when managing expenses.

- Starts with an initial defined budget
- Proceeds to display various prompts listing different types of expenses 
- Whichever option user chooses for that prompt's expense gets subtracted from the current budget
- After all prompts have been answered, displays a results page that reflects if the user finished under or over the original budget.

- Reflects both negative and positive balances for current/end budget
- Needed to handle ~60 concurrent users
- Hosted using Vercel
